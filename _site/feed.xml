        <title>Saving Marples Conclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied the same steps to resorting the remainging Marples chisels that I did to the 3/4” chisel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They turned out wonderfully well.  Additionally, before sharpening, I used the buffing wheel with the green compound to polish the non-cutting edges of the chisel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-10-1-savingMarplesConclusion/IMG_8135.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8135&quot; width=&quot;360px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the whole set.  Not bad for $7.50 a chisel with shipping.  The 3/4” has already cut two deep through mortices and seems to hold it’s edge well.  It still needs some more work as the last owner sharpened the tip with what seems like a camber and thinned out the very tip from the back as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Saving Marples</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chisels.  What’s good?  What’s bad?  What’s average?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some Buck’s Brothers chisels from the big box store and they are new, have some sort of composite handles, and seem to be usable for fine woodworking.  I learned years after acquiring them that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularwoodworking.com/editors-blog/2018-anarchists-gift-guide-day-8-buck-bros-chisels/&quot;&gt;Chris Schwarz recommends them&lt;/a&gt; as a decent starter set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year or so though, I have decided to go primarily to hand tool oriented woodworking and chisels have become extremely more important than saw blade and router bit selection.  Paul Sellers promotes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulsellers.com/2014/08/which-chisels-should-you-buy/&quot;&gt;you don’t need expensive tools&lt;/a&gt; to do great work.  That supported my ownership of Buck Brother’s chisels as well as my exploration of Harbor Freight Windsor chisels.  I’m still using those both for workbench building and am continuing to review the HF chisels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow hand tools woodworking blogs and sites, many people express concern over the big box and china made products specifically around their low quality tool steel and that they won’t hold an edge for very long.  I get the feeling that anything that is not more high end (Veritas, Narnex, Lie Nelson) is substandard and frowned upon.  No doubt, one day I would love to treat myself to tools by these folks with their wonderful engineering and quality.  I’m not yet at that point in my hobby work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m worried.  Will I be fighting the chisels I do have?  Will I be unnecessarily struggling to do quality work because of substandard tools that won’t hold an edge?  I continue to scan eBay for deals on woodworking hand tools, and came across an interesting post of Marple chisels.  This name is in my brain because of Paul Sellers posts about these &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulsellers.com/2021/02/not-significant/&quot;&gt;Marple chisels&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulsellers.com/2014/02/many-chisel-choices/&quot;&gt;Aldi’s aren’t available&lt;/a&gt;, but he has fond memories of and still apparently uses at times these Marples blue handled chisels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are four Marples chisels that seems to have been lovingly use but have been left neglected with a coating of rust on them.  Listed for $88 dollars but half off at $44.  After some back and forth, I was able to acquire them for $20 and was out the door at $30 with shipping.  $7.50 a chisel…  and hoping that they will clean up to good usable chisels with great tool steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8119.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;ebay posting of Marple chisels&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-start&quot;&gt;The Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the chisels as described, with a consistent coating of rust.  They do appear to be lovingly used, rusty, but with plenty of meat left on the bone. There is some weird sharpening and dings, but not overcomable, I decided to start with the 3/4 inch chisel since I’m mid-workbench build and have to finish some mortises the are laid out to 3/4 inch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8073.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8073&quot; width=&quot;360px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8074.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8074&quot; width=&quot;360px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The jury is still out on the 1” which is lowest in the picture above, but I’m going to restore and turn up the 3/4” first which is the top chisel pictured above&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-restore-process&quot;&gt;The Restore Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some googling as well as review of restoring plane irons and removing rust from some of my knives, I decided to start with a scrub with baking soda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8076.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8076&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was some attention with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.big45metalcleaner.com&quot;&gt;Big 45 Metal Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8083.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8083&quot; width=&quot;450px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8085.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8085&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8086.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8086&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time with the Big 45Metal Cleaner resulted in a rust free fairly smooth surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for markings on the blade, but found none.  So I progressed next to sandpaper.  I started with some 200 and moved back and forth from 200, to 320.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8093.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8093&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8094.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8094&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the bevel and tip, I moved to my plane blade restore process and moved to 120 grit sticky backed sandpaper.  I then moved on to finer grit sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8098.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8098&quot; width=&quot;260px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8099.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8099&quot; width=&quot;260px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8102.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8102&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I started grinding the tip incorrectly at 30°.  But it helped to get rid of the digging on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8103.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8103&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I adjusted the chisel in the guide to 25° and sanded on 120 grit as well as 220 and 320 wet/dry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I next moved on to the back with some sand paper as well as went through various grits of water stones.  Once we were in the ballpark, I moved to the diamond stones to finish up the initialization and sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8104.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I went through the various diamond stones both on the back as well as the bevel I moved to polishing the back on a piece of wood – the back side of my strope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8108.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8108&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8109.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8109&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I polished the top side and side bevels as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved on to the strope with the bevel and main blade of the chisel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8106.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8106&quot; width=&quot;320px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8111.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8111&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chisel turned out great.  The surfaces turned out flat and with a good polish.  Seems as if the one of the proper owners gridded the back side of the tip (flat side) and may take a couple of sharpening to get past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8113.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8113&quot; width=&quot;450px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8114.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8114&quot; width=&quot;450px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think the restore turned out great.  I was not restoring for collector purposes, but for usage purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8115.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8115&quot; width=&quot;320px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1/2’ unrestored on top, 3/4” restored and sharped on bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8116.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8116&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I may hit the chisel with the buffing wheel, I decided to put it to use on a set of mortises on the last leg of my workbench,  It did great and love the feel of the handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8117.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8117&quot; width=&quot;320px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/SavingMarples/IMG_8118.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8118&quot; width=&quot;320px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to follow with the restore and sharpening of the others.  For now, it’s fun to use the “blue chip” Marples 3/4” chisel.  I will also do some comparison to by Buck Brother’s big box store and Harbor Freight Windsor chises in terms of sharpness stamina.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Harbor Freight Chisels - Windsor Design Chisels</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;cheap-wood-chisels---windsor-chisel-set-from-harbor-freight&quot;&gt;Cheap Wood Chisels - Windsor Chisel Set from Harbor Freight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-initial-look-at-the-chisels&quot;&gt;An initial look at the chisels…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-me&quot;&gt;About me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a self-reported amateur, part-time, garage workshop, woodworker. I was primarily power tools before getting the hand tool bug and am now a novice amateur part-time garage workshop hand tool woodworker. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulsellers.com/&quot;&gt;Paul Sellers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://christophermschwarz.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Schwarz&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube and am sold on hand tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-tool-collection&quot;&gt;Building a tool collection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For right or wrong, I started to build a tool collection. I started to acquire some bench planes years ago and then took a break because of house moves and a growing family. I recently was ready to start doing some projects and went down the rabbit hole researching workbenches and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3EpWncNq5QL0QhwUNQb7w&quot;&gt;Paul Sellers on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, his site, and his blog. Further research led to Chris Schwarz, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/lostartpress&quot;&gt;Lost Art Press&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to build a workbench, namely a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2ZiNs_Wek&quot;&gt;Paul Sellers workbench&lt;/a&gt;, I felt the need to tune up a No. 4 Stanley Plane I had already acquired and began working on creating the workbench. As I started to think ahead both for the project and future projects, I started to scan eBay for tools I thought I needed or may need. Apparently, I had the antique and tool bug. More on that in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul talks a lot about not needing to get the expensive tools, and the latest and greatest, that even a cheap, inexpensive, tool can be used for work and with practice, the willingness to try, that some of these cheap knockoffs, China-produced tools, are okay. He has spoken a lot about the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://paulsellers.com/2015/06/aldi-chisels-in-usa-stores/&quot;&gt;Aldi Chisels&lt;/a&gt;” which at one time were available, but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularwoodworking.com/editors-blog/2018-anarchists-gift-guide-day-8-buck-bros-chisels/&quot;&gt;mentions&lt;/a&gt; that Buck Brothers chisels from Home Depot are a good starter set, or acceptable. I was fortunate that I had purchased a small set of those when I bought my first starter home that needed work, As I started to build my workbench, using only hand tools, I purchased more Buck Brothers chisels to round out my set. But they have handles not made of wood, and chopping mortises and levering out the waste proved that these handles are not the most comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;windsor-calling&quot;&gt;Windsor Calling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic of the Aldi chisels seems to be that they hand wood handles and were roughly designed for woodworking. They weren’t perfect, but they had good bones. Decent handle, and decent metal that holds an edge to some degree, but they are not as refined as the $45+ chisels (I really mean the $80-90+ per chisel chisels). Here comes Harbor Freight. Their clamps are decent… and they stock the $10 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harborfreight.com/brands/windsor-design/wood-chisel-set-6-piece-56364.html&quot;&gt;Windsor Chisel Set&lt;/a&gt;. Wood handles, nice length, and sizes 1/4”, 1/2”, 3/4”, 1”, 1 1/4” and 1 1/2”… all for $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sawmillcreek.org/showthread.php?255878-A-look-at-Harbor-Frieght-Wood-Chisels&quot;&gt;reviews are sketchy&lt;/a&gt;. Some talk about the metal and its ability to hold an edge. Some have issues with fit and finish, unsquare, grinding of bevels, and handle cracking out of the package. (Many talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lumberjocks.com/threads/luckily-you-dont-always-get-what-you-pay-for.323418/&quot;&gt;not being sharp out of the package&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s my amateur understanding that no chisel comes truly ready to go, they all need flattening and sharpening)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/388259/can_harbor_freight_chisels_ever_be_good_chisels/&quot;&gt;One review&lt;/a&gt;, that I give the most weight to, talks about the beveled edge and thickness as it approaches the tip in relation to the ability to clean out a dovetail, these are too thick and too near the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those concerns in mind, I bought two packs. HF has a 90-day return policy on these and my thinking was to go through them picking out the best from each size and return a full set. If I found a cracked handle or badly ground chisel it would be easier than running back and forth to the store and pressing my luck with a full set of chisels each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8003.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8003&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initial-analysis&quot;&gt;Initial Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that in mind, I hope to provide a little detail about these chisels to aid others in deciding for themselves about getting and using these. I admit that I have never used a professional or high-end chisel and do hope to justify the expense in the future based on my growing skills, time available to do woodworking and a backlog of stuff I want to build. But for now, I have a set of Bucks and some of these HF Windsors lying around, might as well use and abuse these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opened the first pack carefully, so I could return them if needed, and started to inspect the handles and side bevels, compare them to my Buck Brothers, and check them for square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8012.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8012&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, all of the handles seem to be in good shape. Definitely a bit warmer feeling in the hand than whatever hard compound the Bucks have as a handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/11WC-4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11WC-4-1&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;https://www.wonkeedonkeetools.co.uk/media/wysiwyg/11WC-Wood-Chisels-David/11WC04/11WC-4-1.jpg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chisel is longer than my Bucks both overall as well as in most cases the “blade” part as well. Windsor 3/4” in chisel, blade 3 3/4” long, overall around 9 1/2” long compared to the Buck 3/4” blade at 3” long and overall about 8 1/4”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8008.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8008&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparing the side bevels, the image shows 3/4” size of both brands, the Windsors side bevel indeed haven’t been ground down as much as the Buck Brothers which produces a thicker edge throughout the side all the way down to the tip. At this point, I’m not sure how the extra thickness will impact my work so I can’t really speak to how big of a deal this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8015.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8015&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Buck Bros on the left, HF Windsor on the right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In checking square, it seems like they are really close if not right on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8005.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;3/4” chisel squareness check&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8006.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8006&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;1/2” chisel squareness check&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second squareness image shows how the side bevels are not ground the same on that chisel, but again, I’m not sure how much that will impact usability and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to sharpening. I’m still working on cutting our mortices, so I picked the 3/4” of both and flattened the backs and sharpened the edge. Both have a hollow behind the tip but both took an edge with about the same effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8018.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8018&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2023-9-1 Cheap Chisels/IMG_8021.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8021&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall on the pack I’ve opened the handles seem to be in good shape and the chisels seem to be usably square. My next steps are to put them to use side-by-side with the Bucks and see how they perform and hold up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one blog post put it, comparing two cheap or low-quality chisels is pointless. Hopefully one day I will obtain some “better” chisels and then be able to experience and speak better to the differences. At this point, I’m focusing on usability to get the job done and the general enjoyment that these allow me to engage in creating and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…More to follow…&lt;/p&gt;
