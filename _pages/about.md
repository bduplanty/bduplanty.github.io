I am a lifelong educator, saxophonist, former director of bands, a licensed amateur radio operator since 1988, former BBS operator, dabbler in coding...

I am a self-reported amateur, part-time, garage workshop, woodworker. I was primarily power tools before getting the hand tool bug and am now a novice amateur part-time garage workshop hand tool woodworker. I found [Paul Sellers](https://paulsellers.com/) and [Chris Schwarz](https://christophermschwarz.com/) on YouTube and am sold on hand tools.
